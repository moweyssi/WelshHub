This is a static \\nbuilding physics modelling method derived from the Building Research \\nEstablishment’s Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM).  It is less flexible \\nthan the BREDEM model itself as certain parameters are either fixed or \\nrestricted to a specific range.  A SAP calculation will model heat loss, \\ninternal gains, solar gains, energy balance, carbon emissions, heating, \\nventilation, internal lighting, cooling and renewable energy sources.   \\n \\nBuilding Regulations Part L1A sets out how SAP should be used to \\ndetermine whether a new building will meet current building \\nregulations.  There are several criteria – however, the most fundamental \\npart of Part L1A’s approach is the ‘notional building’ method.  This \\nmethod uses a set of pre-defined performance characteristics1 which are \\napplied to the shape/size and layout of a new building to determine a \\ntarget emissions level.  These performance characteristics have been \\nchosen to reduce emissions levels by a certain percentage from a 1990 baseline and thus have been \\ngradually tightened over the years.  The SAP modelling method is used for both the notional and  \\nproposed building. \\n \\n \\n', 'Page 5': ' \\n  \\nThis use of the notional building method generates a Target Emissions Rate (TER) which the Dwelling \\nEmission Rate (DER) of new building must not exceed.  The SAP model also includes a Fabric Energy \\nEfficiency (FEE) calculation which is the amount of energy (in kWh/m2.year) needed to meet the space \\nheating and cooling demand of the dwelling – i.e. it is a measure of the efficiency of the fabric and \\nventilation of the dwelling.  The notional building values are also used as part of this calculation to generate \\na Target Fabric Energy Efficiency (TFEE) for the new dwelling’s Dwelling Fabric Energy Efficiency (DFEE). \\n \\nTo be compliant with Part L, a new dwelling must not exceed either the TER or the TFEE.  However, neither \\nof these targets is shown on the EPC, and they do not need to be achieved for an EPC to be generated. \\n \\nFor existing buildings, an up-to-date EPC is required for sale or rent.  This is normally generated using the \\nReduced SAP (RdSAP) methodology.  This method involves a qualified assessor visiting the property and \\nproviding a reduced set of inputs for the SAP model.  Many of the modelling parameters that can be changed \\nin the full SAP model are either fixed, or linked to a series of look-up tables – e.g. entering a building’s age \\nand type will generate a set of standard u-values for floors/walls etc.  Thus, a RdSAP model is likely to be less \\naccurate than a full SAP model.  For an existing property that is not undergoing renovation, there is no \\nrequirement to meet any Part L criteria for the EPC to be generated. \\n \\nIt should be noted that Part L (for new dwellings) is currently under review with proposed further reductions \\nin TER of 20% or 32% on current levels. \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n', 'Page 6': ' \\nSAP is often maligned as not being particularly accurate and not suitable for certain situations.  However, we \\nshould remember that SAP is intended as a compliance tool and it is Part L which sets out how the tool is to \\nbe used.  To achieve consistency across the country, SAP necessarily makes a few assumptions: \\n \\n - \\nIt places every dwelling in the centre of the country (East Pennines) so that the climate conditions \\nare always the same \\n - \\nIt uses the floor area of the dwelling to work out a typical number of occupants \\n - \\nIt assumes a typical Mon to Fri and Sat/Sun heating cycle \\n  \\nThis means that if you built two houses to exactly the same specification, one in Cornwall occupied by a \\nfamily of four who are out during the day and one in Scotland with a single occupant working from home, \\nyou would get the same EPC rating – which is exactly what SAP is supposed to deliver.  However, in reality, \\nthe actual energy use of each property is likely to be different. \\n \\n  \\nWe thought we’d test the accuracy of SAP by modelling the same building in both SAP and the Passivhaus \\nPlanning Package (PHPP). We know that PHPP models actual energy demand to a high level of accuracy.  \\nSeveral studies have shown that the in-use measurement of space-heating demand in low-energy buildings  \\ncorrelates very closely with predicted demand in PHPP2.  However, PHPP generally requires more detailed \\ninput and more training for modellers/designers. Is SAP as good? \\n \\nWe modelled a 100m2 two storey building with 15% of its walls used for glazing.  It is located in the East \\nPennines, uses direct electric heating and an immersion heater for hot water.  Its fabric u-values, glazing and \\nthermal bridges are specified to achieve the Passivhaus standard.  We got the following results: \\n \\n Energy Use \\nSAP Result (kWh/a) \\nPHPP Result (kWh/a) \\n Space Heating \\n1997 \\n1939 \\n Domestic Hot Water \\n1780 \\n1693 \\n Pumps and fans \\n255 \\n418 \\n Lighting \\n410 \\n100 \\n Total \\n4442 \\n4151 \\n  \\nThese results show that SAP is actually very close to PHPP for both space heating and hot water in this case.  \\nSo, SAP is really doing quite a good job at what it is intended to do.  However, the more a dwelling diverges \\nfrom the standard assumptions within SAP, the less accurate the modelling becomes.  In particular, Internal \\nHeat Gains and the efficiency of MVHR systems differ significantly from SAP to PHPP.  Both of these areas \\nbecome increasingly important as the fabric performance of the dwelling improves \\n  \\n \\n How does SAP work? \\n How accurate is SAP? \\n', 'Page 7': ' \\nUsing the EPC rating to try and drive lower emissions is unlikely to work in practice.  There are several \\nreasons for this. \\n \\nFirst, Part L1A mandates the use of a ‘notional building’ technique as described above.  The problem with \\nthis method is that the actual amount of emissions could still be relatively large – particularly if the design of \\nthe building is poor.  For example, a sprawling, complex shape with lots of glazing will have a relatively high \\nrate of emissions even with reasonably good fabric u-values.  This means that you are starting your \\nreductions from, in effect, an arbitrary starting point.  This is illustrated in the charts below. \\n \\n  \\nSecond, whilst Part L does set a minimum standard for just the fabric elements, these are backstop values \\ndesigned to prevent poor practice rather than encourage good fabric values.  Whilst the Target Fabric Energy \\nEfficiency (TFEE) does force a minnimum level of fabric efficiency, this level is not particularly stringent in \\nmost areas and, in particular, the notional building includes only natural ventilation – so extremely high \\nlevels of fabric efficiency, achievable only through Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR), are \\nnot demanded. \\n \\nCritically, the Dwelling Emission Rate and EPC rating includes the offsetting effect of any photovoltaic panels \\nand so you can achieve a very high EPC rating on a dwelling with an average fabric performance by adding a \\nmodest amount of PV generation.   \\n \\nYou might say that’s acceptable as the electrical energy generated by the PV offsets the energy used by the \\ndwelling.  However, the problem is that the emission rate associated with electricity is reducing due to more \\nrenewables at national level and is already lower than gas.  As this reduces further, the emissions associated \\nwith a dwelling which uses gas (e.g. for heating and hot water) will far outweigh the emissions saving from \\ngenerating electricity.  This will be reflected in the environmental impact rating shown on the EPC, but, as \\nmentioned earlier, this is rarely used and is not placed prominently on the EPC.  \\n \\nFinally, the EPC rating itself is a cost-based index – i.e. the final score is linked to how much the type of \\nenergy used costs.  As gas is (and is likely to remain) far cheaper than electricity, a dwelling that uses \\nelectricity in preference to gas for heating will be penalised.  However, as set out above, with the emissions \\nrate for electricity dropping, an electric-based dwelling will result in a lower rate of emissions. \\n Does a better EPC rating equal lower emissions? \\n', 'Page 8': ' \\nConsider two dwellings.  One is a single storey 100m2 building with 20% of its walls used for glazing and a \\n2.5kWp solar PV array on the roof.  It uses a gas boiler for heating and hot water.  The fabric u-values, glazing \\nand thermal bridging are specified to achieve a minimum pass against the SAP fabric criteria. \\n \\nThe second is a 100m2 two storey building with 15% of its walls used for glazing.  It has no solar PV, and uses \\ndirect electric heating and an immersion heater for hot water.  Its fabric u-values, glazing and thermal \\nbridges are specified to achieve the Passivhaus standard. \\n \\nWe’ve modelled both buildings in SAP and the second one in the Passivhaus modelling software PHPP (to \\ncheck it passes the Passivhaus criteria).  We’ve then used the SAP results from within the SAP software to \\ncalculate the emissions rate for both buildings.  We’ve done this for two different scenarios: \\n \\n - \\nUsing the projected 2020 emissions level for electricity of 0.145 kgCO2/kWh from the National Grid’s \\nFuture Energy Scenarios and the latest proposed emissions figure from SAP 10.1 for gas of 0.21 \\nkgCO2/kWh. \\n \\n - \\nUsing the projected 2030 emissions level for electricity of 0.102 kgCO2/kWh, also taken from the \\nNational Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios.  Gas emissions are assumed to remain as for 2020.  \\n  \\nThe illustration and table below show the relative EPC scores and net emissions levels of the two buildings \\nfor both scenarios. \\n  \\n Dwelling \\nEPC \\nRating \\n Emission Rate with 2020 SAP \\nFigures (kgCO2/year) \\n Emission Rate with 2030 \\nProjections (kgCO2/year) \\n Single storey 100m2 with gas heating \\nand hot water.

No PV. \\n C(80) \\n644 \\n462 \\n An example \\n', 'Page 9': ' \\nThe results show that the two storey building with its more efficient shape, better fabric values and all \\nelectric heating/hot water produces around 60% less emissions in 2020 which increases to more than 70% \\nless by 2030.  The net emissions from the single storey dwelling actually increase over the same period as \\nthe PV has less of an offset effect against the gas. \\n \\nThis shows that using an EPC rating to try and achieve carbon emissions reductions is unlikely to have the \\ndesired effect, as the cheapest way to achieve a higher EPC rating is to add even a small amount of PV.  \\nInstead, we need to find a way to drive improvements in the fabric performance, which will have a much \\nmore significant and long-lasting effect and will also be independent of energy sources whose carbon \\nintensities are constantly changing over time. \\n \\nThis conclusion is backed up by real-world monitoring.  The chart below shows the measured total energy \\nuse and EPC band for a sample of 410 homes.  The SAP calculation does not include detailed modelling of \\noccupancy behaviour, nor does it include unregulated energy use (i.e. appliances and plug loads), so a \\ndiscrepancy between modelled energy and actual energy use is expected.  However, with space heating \\nconstituting by far the largest percentage of energy demand in most dwellings, some sort of positive \\ncorrelation between EPC band and overall energy use would be expected.  In fact, there is a very weak \\ncorrelation with the best performing Band E home out-performing the best performing Band B dwelling.  \\nWhilst there may be other underlying reasons behind this data such as errors in EPC assessments and \\noccupant behaviour, it neatly illustrates the futility of using the EPC rating as a measure of energy efficiency. \\n \\n  \\n  \\n Figure 1: Illustration of disconnect between EPC bands and actual energy consumption in the domestic sector: Energy intensity \\nof 410 homes across a local authority in England, by EPC rating.

As mentioned above, the EPC rating is just one of the outputs from the SAP model.  A full SAP \\nmodel3 produces several other outputs which would actually be more useful to drive energy efficiency.  The \\nSAP methodology is in the public domain4 and the accredited software packages that undertake the SAP \\ncalculation produce detailed output reports which are required to demonstrate compliance with Building \\nRegulations.  Included in these reports is a definitive number for the space heating demand of the building, \\nexpressed in kWh/m2.year.  Whilst this number has been calculated by the SAP methodology, it is equivalent \\nto the space heating demand calculated in a PHPP model. This number is also not related to the notional \\nbuilding method – it is simply the amount of energy required to heat the building over the course of the \\nyear. It will be higher for a building with an inefficient form factor and worse fabric performance, it is \\nindependent of any add-on renewable energy generation, and it is unaffected by fluctuations in price, so \\ndoesn’t have the disadvantages of the EPC rating.   \\n \\nIs it accurate enough? The calculation above shows that a SAP model can correlate well with a PHPP model, \\nbut certain building features prevalent in low-energy dwellings5, will make the modelling less accurate.  \\nFurthermore, Reduced SAP (RdSAP) models are likely to demonstrate significant variance as a result of the \\nincreased number of underlying assumptions.  So, this indication of space heating demand may not always \\nbe as accurate as we would like.  However, with no other national methodology available, we have to rely on \\nthe output from the tools we have.  \\n \\nSetting a target for this definitive number, the space heating demand, offers a viable potential alternative to \\nusing EPC ratings to drive efficiency.  As space heating demand is affected primarily by the quality of the \\nfabric, ventilation strategy and the efficiency of form/orientation6, this is, in effect, mandating that the fabric \\nof the building meet minimum efficiency targets. To ensure that the dwelling is also affordable to run, the \\nEPC rating could be retained to complement this metric. \\n \\nA second advantage of using a definitive energy demand target is the actual energy use can then be \\npredicted and, when offset by sufficient renewable energy generation, either locally or regionally, it can be \\nshown that a net zero target has been achieved. \\n \\nAnalysis by the Passivhaus Trust7 has shown that new dwellings are currently being designed with a \\npredicted average space heating demand of around 54 kWh/m2.year. \\n \\nSo, an example of a staged policy approach to target dwelling energy efficiency might be: \\n \\n  \\n(2019) \\n2020 \\n2022 \\n2024 \\n2026 \\n Space Heating Demand (kWh/m2.year) \\n55 \\n45 \\n30 \\n20 \\n15 \\n Minimum EPC Rating \\nC \\nC \\nB \\nB \\nA \\n So what’s the alternative? \\n', 'Page 11': ' \\nSAP is a modelling procedure that produces a number of potentially useful outputs and is used in several \\ndifferent ways for different purposes.  It is actually very good at what it is intended to be – a compliance tool. \\n \\nHowever, the current Part L and EPC methodology means that an overall cost-based rating for the EPC, \\nbased on the notional building method, is the headline metric which is being used to try and drive energy \\nefficiency.  As the carbon emissions associated with expensive electricity continue to reduce, this makes the \\nEPC rating system increasingly inaccurate and means that a highly rated dwelling could potentially produce a \\nvery high rate of emissions.   \\n \\nOrganisations seeking to drive improvements in energy efficiency should therefore use space heating \\ndemand as the primary metric, derived either from a SAP or PHPP calculation, alongside the EPC’s cost-based \\nindex, in order to drive the sector towards buildings which are both affordable, highly energy efficient and \\nlow in emissions. \\n Conclusion \\n  \\n'}\n",

However, the more a dwelling diverges \\nfrom the standard assumptions within SAP, the less accurate the modelling becomes.  In particular, Internal \\nHeat Gains and the efficiency of MVHR systems differ significantly from SAP to PHPP.  Both of these areas \\nbecome increasingly important as the fabric performance of the dwelling improves \\n  \\n \\n How does SAP work? \\n How accurate is SAP? \\n', ' \\nUsing the EPC rating to try and drive lower emissions is unlikely to work in practice.  There are several \\nreasons for this. \\n \\nFirst, Part L1A mandates the use of a ‘notional building’ technique as described above.  The problem with \\nthis method is that the actual amount of emissions could still be relatively large – particularly if the design of \\nthe building is poor.  For example, a sprawling, complex shape with lots of glazing will have a relatively high \\nrate of emissions even with reasonably good fabric u-values.  This means that you are starting your \\nreductions from, in effect, an arbitrary starting point.  This is illustrated in the charts below. \\n \\n  \\nSecond, whilst Part L does set a minimum standard for just the fabric elements, these are backstop values \\ndesigned to prevent poor practice rather than encourage good fabric values.  Whilst the Target Fabric Energy \\nEfficiency (TFEE) does force a minnimum level of fabric efficiency, this level is not particularly stringent in \\nmost areas and, in particular, the notional building includes only natural ventilation – so extremely high \\nlevels of fabric efficiency, achievable only through Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR), are \\nnot demanded. \\n \\nCritically, the Dwelling Emission Rate and EPC rating includes the offsetting effect of any photovoltaic panels \\nand so you can achieve a very high EPC rating on a dwelling with an average fabric performance by adding a \\nmodest amount of PV generation.   \\n \\nYou might say that’s acceptable as the electrical energy generated by the PV offsets the energy used by the \\ndwelling.  However, the problem is that the emission rate associated with electricity is reducing due to more \\nrenewables at national level and is already lower than gas.  As this reduces further, the emissions associated \\nwith a dwelling which uses gas (e.g. for heating and hot water) will far outweigh the emissions saving from \\ngenerating electricity.  This will be reflected in the environmental impact rating shown on the EPC, but, as \\nmentioned earlier, this is rarely used and is not placed prominently on the EPC.  \\n \\nFinally, the EPC rating itself is a cost-based index – i.e. the final score is linked to how much the type of \\nenergy used costs.  As gas is (and is likely to remain) far cheaper than electricity, a dwelling that uses \\nelectricity in preference to gas for heating will be penalised.  However, as set out above, with the emissions \\nrate for electricity dropping, an electric-based dwelling will result in a lower rate of emissions. \\n Does a better EPC rating equal lower emissions? \\n', ' \\nConsider two dwellings.  One is a single storey 100m2 building with 20% of its walls used for glazing and a \\n2.5kWp solar PV array on the roof.  It uses a gas boiler for heating and hot water.  The fabric u-values, glazing \\nand thermal bridging are specified to achieve a minimum pass against the SAP fabric criteria. \\n \\nThe second is a 100m2 two storey building with 15% of its walls used for glazing.  It has no solar PV, and uses \\ndirect electric heating and an immersion heater for hot water.  Its fabric u-values, glazing and thermal \\nbridges are specified to achieve the Passivhaus standard. \\n \\nWe’ve modelled both buildings in SAP and the second one in the Passivhaus modelling software PHPP (to \\ncheck it passes the Passivhaus criteria).  We’ve then used the SAP results from within the SAP software to \\ncalculate the emissions rate for both buildings.  We’ve done this for two different scenarios: \\n \\n - \\nUsing the projected 2020 emissions level for electricity of 0.145 kgCO2/kWh from the National Grid’s \\nFuture Energy Scenarios and the latest proposed emissions figure from SAP 10.1 for gas of 0.21 \\nkgCO2/kWh. \\n \\n - \\nUsing the projected 2030 emissions level for electricity of 0.102 kgCO2/kWh, also taken from the \\nNational Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios.  Gas emissions are assumed to remain as for 2020.  \\n  \\nThe illustration and table below show the relative EPC scores and net emissions levels of the two buildings \\nfor both scenarios. \\n  \\n Dwelling \\nEPC \\nRating \\n Emission Rate with 2020 SAP \\nFigures (kgCO2/year) \\n Emission Rate with 2030 \\nProjections (kgCO2/year) \\n Single storey 100m2 with gas heating \\nand hot water.

No PV. \\n C(80) \\n644 \\n462 \\n An example \\n', ' \\nThe results show that the two storey building with its more efficient shape, better fabric values and all \\nelectric heating/hot water produces around 60% less emissions in 2020 which increases to more than 70% \\nless by 2030.  The net emissions from the single storey dwelling actually increase over the same period as \\nthe PV has less of an offset effect against the gas. \\n \\nThis shows that using an EPC rating to try and achieve carbon emissions reductions is unlikely to have the \\ndesired effect, as the cheapest way to achieve a higher EPC rating is to add even a small amount of PV.  \\nInstead, we need to find a way to drive improvements in the fabric performance, which will have a much \\nmore significant and long-lasting effect and will also be independent of energy sources whose carbon \\nintensities are constantly changing over time. \\n \\nThis conclusion is backed up by real-world monitoring.  The chart below shows the measured total energy \\nuse and EPC band for a sample of 410 homes.  The SAP calculation does not include detailed modelling of \\noccupancy behaviour, nor does it include unregulated energy use (i.e. appliances and plug loads), so a \\ndiscrepancy between modelled energy and actual energy use is expected.  However, with space heating \\nconstituting by far the largest percentage of energy demand in most dwellings, some sort of positive \\ncorrelation between EPC band and overall energy use would be expected.  In fact, there is a very weak \\ncorrelation with the best performing Band E home out-performing the best performing Band B dwelling.  \\nWhilst there may be other underlying reasons behind this data such as errors in EPC assessments and \\noccupant behaviour, it neatly illustrates the futility of using the EPC rating as a measure of energy efficiency. \\n \\n  \\n  \\n Figure 1: Illustration of disconnect between EPC bands and actual energy consumption in the domestic sector: Energy intensity \\nof 410 homes across a local authority in England, by EPC rating.

As mentioned above, the EPC rating is just one of the outputs from the SAP model.  A full SAP \\nmodel3 produces several other outputs which would actually be more useful to drive energy efficiency.  The \\nSAP methodology is in the public domain4 and the accredited software packages that undertake the SAP \\ncalculation produce detailed output reports which are required to demonstrate compliance with Building \\nRegulations.  Included in these reports is a definitive number for the space heating demand of the building, \\nexpressed in kWh/m2.year.  Whilst this number has been calculated by the SAP methodology, it is equivalent \\nto the space heating demand calculated in a PHPP model. This number is also not related to the notional \\nbuilding method – it is simply the amount of energy required to heat the building over the course of the \\nyear. It will be higher for a building with an inefficient form factor and worse fabric performance, it is \\nindependent of any add-on renewable energy generation, and it is unaffected by fluctuations in price, so \\ndoesn’t have the disadvantages of the EPC rating.   \\n \\nIs it accurate enough? The calculation above shows that a SAP model can correlate well with a PHPP model, \\nbut certain building features prevalent in low-energy dwellings5, will make the modelling less accurate.  \\nFurthermore, Reduced SAP (RdSAP) models are likely to demonstrate significant variance as a result of the \\nincreased number of underlying assumptions.  So, this indication of space heating demand may not always \\nbe as accurate as we would like.  However, with no other national methodology available, we have to rely on \\nthe output from the tools we have.  \\n \\nSetting a target for this definitive number, the space heating demand, offers a viable potential alternative to \\nusing EPC ratings to drive efficiency.  As space heating demand is affected primarily by the quality of the \\nfabric, ventilation strategy and the efficiency of form/orientation6, this is, in effect, mandating that the fabric \\nof the building meet minimum efficiency targets. To ensure that the dwelling is also affordable to run, the \\nEPC rating could be retained to complement this metric. \\n \\nA second advantage of using a definitive energy demand target is the actual energy use can then be \\npredicted and, when offset by sufficient renewable energy generation, either locally or regionally, it can be \\nshown that a net zero target has been achieved. \\n \\nAnalysis by the Passivhaus Trust7 has shown that new dwellings are currently being designed with a \\npredicted average space heating demand of around 54 kWh/m2.year. \\n \\nSo, an example of a staged policy approach to target dwelling energy efficiency might be: \\n \\n  \\n(2019) \\n2020 \\n2022 \\n2024 \\n2026 \\n Space Heating Demand (kWh/m2.year) \\n55 \\n45 \\n30 \\n20 \\n15 \\n Minimum EPC Rating \\nC \\nC \\nB \\nB \\nA \\n So what’s the alternative? \\n', ' \\nSAP is a modelling procedure that produces a number of potentially useful outputs and is used in several \\ndifferent ways for different purposes.  It is actually very good at what it is intended to be – a compliance tool. \\n \\nHowever, the current Part L and EPC methodology means that an overall cost-based rating for the EPC, \\nbased on the notional building method, is the headline metric which is being used to try and drive energy \\nefficiency.  As the carbon emissions associated with expensive electricity continue to reduce, this makes the \\nEPC rating system increasingly inaccurate and means that a highly rated dwelling could potentially produce a \\nvery high rate of emissions.   \\n \\nOrganisations seeking to drive improvements in energy efficiency should therefore use space heating \\ndemand as the primary metric, derived either from a SAP or PHPP calculation, alongside the EPC’s cost-based \\nindex, in order to drive the sector towards buildings which are both affordable, highly energy efficient and \\nlow in emissions. \\n Conclusion \\n  \\n']\n",
