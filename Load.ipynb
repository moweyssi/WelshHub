      "To increase the energy efficiency of your home, it is important to focus on implementing energy efficiency measures such as improving insulation, reducing draughts, and upgrading heating systems. These measures can lead to reduced carbon emissions, lower energy bills, and a more comfortable living environment. While some homes may have basic measures like cavity wall and loft insulation, there is still a need for more comprehensive solutions for properties that are considered 'hard to treat.' This includes implementing measures like solid wall insulation, floor insulation, and secondary glazing. New technical approaches, materials, and funding mechanisms are necessary to address the energy efficiency challenges faced by older buildings, especially those with traditional construction techniques. By investing in energy-saving upgrades and adopting innovative solutions like those offered by Q-Bots, significant energy savings can be achieved in older buildings.\n"
